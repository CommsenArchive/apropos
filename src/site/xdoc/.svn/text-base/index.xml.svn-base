			<p>
				Stopwatch was ment to replace <code>System.currentTimeMillis()</code>
				calls, match like Log4j replaced <code>System.out.println()</code>
				calls. To see how it does that go to 
				<a href="quickStart.html" >Quick Start</a> page.

		<section name="Why Stopwatch">
			<p> Stopwatch was inspired by ATG's performance monitor tool and to be honest, it 
				wouldn't probably never exists if I have discovered 
				<a href="http://www.javaperformancetuning.com/tools/jamon/index.shtml" >JAMon</a> earlier. 
				But I didn't and I couldn't also find any good, open source, performance measurement API, that was able to measure 
				performance of any given piece of java code. So I started writing Stopwatch. Then I thought it may be useful for 
				other people as well and so I decided to make it public. 
				<a href="http://www.SourceForge.net" >SourceForge</a> just seemed the right place for it.   
			</p>
			<p>
				Please keep in mind that Stopwatch is relatively simple piece of software I develop in
				my spare time (which I don't have a lot). If it happens to be of any use for you, please send some feedback. 
				I will highly appreciate it!
